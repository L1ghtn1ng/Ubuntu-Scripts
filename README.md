Thats all you will need as ```Ubuntu``` comes with the rest of the libaries U.S.A.F uses. The one thing you need to make sure
is that you are running ```Python 3``` U.S.A.F will not work. If running on Ubuntu server you will need to install
Python 3 and the libaries that the script you are running require.
